It adds several items to "demise yourself" such as a potion and a custom totem.  
But it also adds items such as a Block of Undying that functions as a Totem of Undying but better.  

There are also custom enchantments for those items such as "Keep Inventory"   
that will help you keep your inventory when you demise using on the mod items.

More items and features will be added over time like jewelry and other more complex ideas.
